# ZipSwitch

*(formerly known as HandShake)*

HackIL Winter 2015 Project

This project was a fun attempt to exchange contact information through a 
simple user interface: a handshake. At a career fair, recruiters and 
students alike could be equipped with Pebble watches to perform this task.
The backend is implemented using Parse and a fixed timeout.
